/**
 * BaseSavingState class
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * In each extended BaseAppCompatActivity and BaseFragmentExtended
 *
 * <code>
 *     public void initOnSaveInstanceStateBody(myOutState){
 *         BaseSavingStateProviderExtendedClass.getInstance().saveinstancestate(myOutState);
 *     }
 *     public void initOnRestoreInstanceStateBody(mySaved){
 *         BaseSavingStateProviderExtendedClass.getInstance().restoreinstancestate(mySaved);
 *     }
 *
 *
 * </code>
 *
 * When app is killed  and restarted it will not restart at the launched activity listed
 * in manifest but start at the last Fragment/Activity user had focus on. Thus, we need to
 * make sure state is saved before that event, hence this solution.
