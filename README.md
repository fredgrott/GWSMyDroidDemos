GWSMyDroidDemos
===============

This code repo serves two purposes. One, to soft fork some libraries I use that needed some code cleanup.
Two, to provide one place to put my UI control demos and application demos. In this readme you will
see links to the videos of the demos and in the application demos case, sometimes apk file links.

UI Control Demos
================

Every 18 to 28 months Google, just like Apple, introduces a new UI set of best practices and
new UI features in a major version Android OS release.  Thus, it is important to understand how to
port features backward to prior OS versions as Google only backports the features it feels are
important.

The UI demos below cover most of the new feature effects of Material backported from the Lollipop and
Marshmellow version releases.

Application Demos
=================

These application demos show a full application in terms of what branding can be done. Branding is important
as we do not have the same massive room of desktop applications to implement branding. But, you are probably
viewing these demos because you want an android developer that customizes UI controls to brand. Hence
this set of application demos.
