GWSMyDroidDemos
===============

This code repo serves two purposes. One, to soft fork some libraries I use that needed some code cleanup.
Two, to provide one place to put my UI control demos and application demos. In this readme you will
see links to the videos of the demos and in the application demos case, sometimes apk file links.

Best Practices
==============

1. Code audit the 3rrd party libraries(non-Google) you use.
2. Material Design
3. Code optimization for Davlik/ART and SMP.
4. Coding to the proper Thread.
5. Catching Memory Leaks, context and otherwise.
6. Proper Debug Logging and privatizing fields so no user information leaks in production builds as user
   enemies love to root a stolen device.
7. Daily builds
8. Cover only one mobile platform at a time. Why? 45 3rd party libraries code cleaned plus the android support
   libraries just to backport material design feature to get a consistent look and feel across all
   Android OS versions in the marketplace.



UI Control Demos
================

Every 18 to 28 months Google, just like Apple, introduces a new UI set of best practices and
new UI features in a major version Android OS release.  Thus, it is important to understand how to
port features backward to prior OS versions as Google only backports the features it feels are
important.

The UI demos below cover most of the new feature effects of Material backported from the Lollipop and
Marshmallow version releases.

Application Demos
=================

These application demos show a full application in terms of what branding can be done. Branding is important
as we do not have the same massive room of desktop applications to implement branding. But, you are probably
viewing these demos because you want an android developer that customizes UI controls to brand. Hence
this set of application demos.

Contacting
==========

Same rules as is on my LinkedIN profile, no recruiters and only funded(beyond speculation seed capital stage)
startups and it would be helpful to view the demos and ask about the code as you would standout from
all the freeloaders who want to exploit that spam me. See my Github profile for the email address(ie click on the shareme link at the top of this page).
