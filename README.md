GWSMyDroidDemos
===============

This code repo serves two purposes. One, to soft fork some libraries I use that needed some code cleanup.
Two, to provide one place to put my UI control demos and application demos. In this readme you will
see links to the videos of the demos and in the application demos case, sometimes apk file links.

Best Practices
==============

The difference between an intern and someone who can code, design, and develop remotely is all-in the 
manual habits an engineer an developer has, which are often called best practices. We have this very immature
form of computer technology in which the software only adapts to those situations in which the software 
developer planned. And to add to that our computer language technology that we use to write programs is 
so immature that its extremely ambiguous in what we mean when we write most code so that we have to manually 
tell the compiler what we mean. Hence, all these manual best practices.

UI Control Demos
================

Every 18 to 28 months Google, just like Apple, introduces a new UI set of best practices and
new UI features in a major version Android OS release.  Thus, it is important to understand how to
port features backward to prior OS versions as Google only backports the features it feels are
important.

The UI demos below cover most of the new feature effects of Material backported from the Lollipop and
Marshmallow version releases.

Application Demos
=================

These application demos show a full application in terms of what branding can be done. Branding is important
as we do not have the same massive room of desktop applications to implement branding. But, you are probably
viewing these demos because you want an android developer that customizes UI controls to brand. Hence
this set of application demos.

About Fred Grott
================

You probably notice that I do things differently as far as code development. My training in code
development comes from having a hands-on-imperative to electronics and code from an early age and
intense passionate interest.  But, its not a free-wheeling process in that I measure myself against
expert developers much like a martial artist like Bruce Lee faced each new area of training and
sparring with other martial artist experts.

I explore things all the time and I am an computer language polyglot. That does not mean that I can
be bothered and spammed to do someone's back-end or front-end in ruby, python, or java as I am
now focused on android native java application development. Some of my explorations have even been
in such diverse subjects as breaking RSA encryption.

I took my years of experience in start-ups on back-ends, front-ends, and mobile java and transition to
developing and designing native java applications for the android OS mobile platform.


Contacting
==========

Same rules as is on my LinkedIN profile, no recruiters and only funded(beyond speculation seed capital stage)
startups and it would be helpful to view the demos and ask about the code as you would standout from
all the freeloaders who want to exploit that spam me. My email is fred dot grott at gmail dot com.
